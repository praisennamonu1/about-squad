          <p>Born in Lagos Nigeria, I schooled in Lagos, Abeokuta, and Ibadan. I 
          have a strong interest in knowledge, research, and development and it 
          was evident from my "destructive" attitude as a child.

          <p>Computer science fundamentals. I’ve always wanted to understand 
          how computers work. How the software works in sync with the 
          materials I learn about in engineering.

          <p>Born in Delta state, Nigeria, I'm a medical
            laboratory scientist who enjoys acquiring
            knowledge and my greatest philosophy is ‘Nothing
            is impossible, you only truly fail when you give
            up, so keep going’.
